# JavaScript Snippets for Sublime

## Install

To install through [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control),
search for **JavaScript Snippets for IMWeb**. If you still don't have Package Control in Sublime Text, [go get it](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation).
It's pure awesomeness.

If you prefer to install it manually, you can download the package and put it inside your `Packages` directory. It should work but will not update automatically.

## Console

### [cd] console.dir

```javascript
console.dir(${1:obj});
```

## MISC

### [mi] new Image

```javascript
new Image().src = '/${1}';
```
